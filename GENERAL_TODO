Here is where we are going to store the general TODO lists.

Project direction
 - Maybe is interesting a radically different approach to a website. Right now we are already simplifying the visuals, but it can be done even more; we can guess something that normally websites do not guess; that the user is CLEVER.
    With this approach for example, in the index page we would not put instructions in the login panel like "Username" or "Password".


Software development
 - Set minimum and maximum lengths for the inputs of the user in the places in which he or she can input something.
